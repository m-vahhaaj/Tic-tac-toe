## What is Tic-tac-toe?
According to Wikipedia, Tic-tac-toe, noughts and crosses, or Xs and Os/“X’y O’sies”, is a game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3×3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a diagonal, horizontal, or vertical row is the winner.
It is very simple and beginner code.

From here you can enter player names to be displayed later on when the game is being played. Default values have been provided so that Player 1 and Player 2 can be used instead.

## Choosing Player Symbol

From here you can choose the symbol that will be used by the competing players. Only one player will get to choose the symbol of his interest and the remaining symbol will automatically be alloted to the other player.

## Playing Area: Winning

This is the grid where the players will place their symbols. If a player places his symbols simultaneously in 3 cells that form a row, column or diagonal then he is declared winner of that round. The winner is awarded a score that can be seen on the right side.

## Playing Area: Tie

This is the grid where the players will place their symbols. If no player is able to make the combination of his symbol in either row, column or diagnally than no one is presumed winner and it is a tie. No one is awarded a score. Total score can be seen on the right side though.

## Hiding score

This is the grid where the players will place their symbols. Players can actually choose to hide scores in order to play casually. Not showing the score makes the game to be played faster rather than playing professionaly and thinking about where to but symbols in order to score a win.

## _Note_
1. You are free to use it for yourself.
2. Feel free to message me to get mor information.
3. I used Swing along with AWT to construct the GUI.
4. It is a very basic program and it lacks many of the essential programming practices, but at that point of time I was only concerned in making it work and adding many features :)
